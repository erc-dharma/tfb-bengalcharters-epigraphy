What I know is this: we never did put licence info inside the Siddham files. I've just checked and the siddham.network website offers its content under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licence, which may be a problem (ND = no derivatives). I wonder if that was done because Michael anticipated DHARMA wanting to reuse those files. However, the original XML files I uploaded to Zenodo (which are in fact what I imported now) are still there under a BY-SA licence, nothing about ND or even NC. (By the way, is there any reason why our files are only BY, without SA? That would mean that any derivatives made later will not have to credit us for the work, wouldn't it?) Should I try to discuss this with Michael? I'd like to avoid fuelling the bad blood between you two, and I would also like to remain on good terms with him, so I'm not very eager to do that, but all in all, it may be best if I initiate it. Also, as you say in your email, we should probably include a reference to the Siddham files. To simplify our lives (and to conform to fact), this could simply be the zip file containing all my XML files on Zenodo, rather than individual siddham.network URLs for each file. -->

Sircar observed as much in the note to his edition. what solution do you prefer?  --><!--daba: Marking just the n as surplus is fine, though it may imply that the extra n is a sort of typo, rather than unexpected grammar. Perhaps tag whole words, but of course with orig and reg (which were not used in Siddham) instead of sic and corr. But this is not a strong preference, and I don't think it matters ultimately. I'm also fine with adding a note, and even with removing the markup if there is a note. See also my reply to brāhmaṇa in l3. --> ca <space/></p>

"The ā mātrā at the end of l3 is far from clear. If it's ṇā, then we expect brāhmaṇāya, so the name of the donee is probably just one akṣara plus svāmin. Perhaps more probably, we have just brāhmaṇa, and then a two-syllable name." 
argr adds: On inspection of the RTI, and presuming that my new reading adhikaraṇaM is the correct reading in line 1, then I find that there can be no serious doubt about the reading ṇa here, even if the akṣara as a whole is not as clear as it could be. That said, I don't find daba's argument about a hypothetical reading with -ṇā incontrovertible. In the Gaya plate there is vrāhmaṇagopadevasvāmine. If the reading is -ṇā, we could very well have a brahmin whose name started with A or Ā. --><!--daba: you are of course right that the name could have started with a or ā, so the brāhmaṇā does not necessarily imply brāhmaṇāya. But I think I disagree about reading ṇā here and in l1. I've just spent a short time looking at the RTI, so I don't want to contradict your judgement right out, but here's how it seems to me. 1. we have a clear ṇa in line 8 (°dhāraṇayā), in which the hook at the top right only extends downward for a short length (I haven't looked for other instances of ṇa, so this may be atypical, but it conforms to my expectations). 2. Clear specimens of ṇā (l3 °ṇāgrahārika; l9 kṣettrāṇām) have a second hook attached to the lower right of the body, bending down and back under the body. 3. The problematic characters (l1 and l3) have the upper right hook extended down below the baseline, then bending back under the body. My conclusion: the problematic characters are a cursive form of ṇā, in which the upper right hook of the body is extended to represent the hook that is the vowel marker. That stroke even has a curve toward the body in l1, and a definite cusp toward the body in l3, which to me indicates that the part of the stroke above that cusp/curve belongs to the body, and the part below it represents the vowel marker. In the RTI, the only thing unclear about the one in l3 is the centre of the body, but the stroke on the right is quite clear. Thus, I suggest reverting to adhikaraṇāM in l1 (could the composer have had adhikaraṇāḥ in mind, to go with the plural verbs?), and brāhmaṇā in l3. -->

It actually looks rather like what I'd expect a halanta N to look like. Could this be one? Or perhaps a halanta N to which an e marker was added subsequently to change it to ne? Or, as you say, a halanta-ish shape used to indicate the pause (virāma) at this point. --> <space/> pañca-mahā-yajña-pravarttanāya khila-kṣettra-kulya-vā<unclear>pa</unclear>-<subst><del>tu</del><add place="overstrike">ca</add></subst>tuṣṭayaṁ kkrītvātisraṣṭuM<!-- daba here had a note: "The halanta M at the end of l4 seems to be a special form; it isn't very clear but perhaps a regular-sized ma with the right vertical extended at the top (bending right pretty high up) and bottom (bending left a little below the baseline)."
argr2daba: but isn't the form well-nigh identical to that in adhikaraṇāM in line 1? --><!--daba: you are right, it is the same form squeezed into a narrower space.

<!-- argr2daba: you had here this note "Sircar says ādyastamba (l9) means "covered with original shrubs". I don't find this very convincing and I'm inclined to think astamba means not planted with grain, or perhaps without grass (for grazing), but the whole expression seems rather uncertain; in my interpretation, the ādi is a bit unexpected."

Can we delete this from here?--><!--daba: sure, feel free to delete any of my comments that are no longer relevant, or contain ideas that don't hold water.

Even if utpratikara is otherwise unattested, ut as a negative prefix is well attested, e.g. utkaca, uddāma; in MW I also find e.g. utpiñjara, indicating (to some extent) that this is an active prefix that can be attached to any noun and not just used in established constructs. I also find "tpra" instead of "pra" a very unlikely scribal mistake. Assuming that reading dhā and dho are equally possible, one that involves a hapax legomenon and no emendation seems to me preferable to one that requires emendation, given that the hapax can be interpreted in the context paired with our knowledge that apratikara, akiṁcit-pratikara and śūnya-pratikara are synonyms for the same thing (so why not another synonym with the same literal meaning?). As for the reading alone, I can't honestly argue that dho is more likely, but it seems to me that the consonant part is quite squat, with what seems to be its headmark positioned below the regular headline. This is not warranted by the descender of dya above, but if there was an e-marker on top of this dh, then the scribe would have had to flatten the dh a little to be able to squeeze that e in between the dh and the descender. If so, the faint stroke(?) that seems to start at the top left of what I take to be the headmark of dh and then curls left and down to (almost) touch the body of dh may well have been that marker. --></note>

<p n="11-13">After eight <foreign>dīnāra</foreign>s had been accepted from this district chief Chattramaha, four <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign>s of uncultivated land have been given in the village Jaṅgoyikā, to the south of Gorakṣita’s gift land <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>tāmrapaṭṭa</foreign></supplied>, to the west of Gopālibhogā <supplied reason="explanation">Gopālī’s property</supplied>. 4 <foreign>ku[lyavāpa]</foreign>.</p>

<p n="13-16">You there <supplied reason="explanation">mentioned at the start of the grant</supplied>, having understood <supplied reason="subaudible">this</supplied>, shall separate them off using two reeds, eight by ninefold with the ladle-work <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>darvīkarma</foreign></supplied> cubit in a place that does not conflict with the cultivation of the landholders; shall make a boundary delimited in the four directions with long-lasting markers such as <supplied reason="subaudible">pots filled with</supplied> chaff or charcoal; shall make the donation and shall protect it in perpetuity according to the rule of a permanent endowment. And out of deference to this rule it is to be protected by present and future administrators.</p>
<p n="16-19">And it has been said by the Lord Vyāsa:</p> 
<p rend="stanza" n="1">The one who would steal land given by himself or another becomes a worm in shit and is cooked with his ancestors.</p>

			<p>First edited, with English translation and photos of estampages of the plate, by N. G. Majumdar (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Majumdar1935-1936_01"/></bibl>); basically the same text was published again, with addition of some explanatory footnotes, by D. C. Sircar (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Sircar1965_02"/><citedRange unit="item">48A</citedRange><citedRange unit="page">382-384</citedRange></bibl>). The text is re-edited here by Arlo Griffiths and Dániel Balogh based on RTIs of the plate, using a digital edition created by Dániel Balogh for the Siddham project as starting point. (Since the readings in that digital edition don't differ from the printed editions, its variant readings are not recorded in our apparatus.)</p>

Since you edition hardly does more than reproduced NGM's, I vote no. --><!--daba: I don't insist, but here are some non-decisive reasons why it may be better to do that. 1. The amount of original work I did on Siddham inscriptions varies greatly, and if we decide to cite or not to cite Siddham on that basis, then in each case someone would have to judge whether or not it deserves to be cited. I definitely think that some of my Siddham inscriptions deserve it. 2. Sircar too did little more than reprint the text. 3. To stay on Michael's good side. // Then again, some likewise non-decisive reasons why not to: 1. The Siddham edition is credited anyway in the header. 2. I agree with you about there being no need (in this particular case) to cite any of my readings in the apparatus. So: I'm undecided. If you prefer no, I'm OK with that. I do think that, as you suggest in your email, it should say "re-edited here by Arlo Griffiths and Dániel Balogh" here. -->
