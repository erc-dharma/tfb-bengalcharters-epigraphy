daba-siddham: Not sure about kāritaka. B and Agrawala print the ta as unclear and the ka as clear (Agrawala then emends to kāritakaḥ). Both are quite indistinct in my facsimiles, but other solutions seem equally plausible: 1. read kāritaḥ, with a scratch on the plate between the dots of the visarga; 2. read kārito, followed by a malformed character; 3. combine these two and assume first-hand correction from kāritaḥ to kārito: the indistinctness of the o mātrā of the t would then be explained by its being a later addition, and the scratch across the visarga could be a deletion mark. Note though that -svāminaḥ devakulas is not corrected later on in the same line. 
--><!-- 
daba : B and Agrawala both correct devakulas to devakulam and all adjectives and the pronoun to neuter. This seems like over-correction to me.

L5. SI says ādyastamba means "covered with original shrub, i.e. fallow". I don't find this very convincing and I'm inclined to think astamba means not planted with grain, or perhaps without grass (for grazing), but the whole expression seems rather uncertain; in my interpretation, the ādi is a bit unexpected.

But the photo shows the character clearly: there is neither a subscript v, nor an ā mātrā here, only a śa, with the top stroke extended on the left toward the ā of lyā. This may have been meant as correction from śa to ma, transforming the top stroke into a headmark. The right descender does not seem to have been deleted or corrected.

But here as the land yields no tax, the benefit for the king is only meritorious and due to his act of protection. This understanding is also confirmed by the final stanzas which emphasises the act of protection. 
So perhaps add in a note the reference to Yājñavalkya I.331 (Olivelle 2019, p.107) to explain why the king obtain this sixth part :
