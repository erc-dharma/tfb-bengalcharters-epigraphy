daba siddham : The editions of Sircar_1943a, Sanyal and Agrawala (who may be copying Sircar SI) differ in many small details, e.g. over what they show as clear and unclear. I'm keeping track only of major editorial differences, and mark the text up according to my reading of the facsimile.

The one after that (ta/ṭa) is just a trace, could be ṭa, not ta, perhaps dha or ba.The next one is imo definitely not ṅka; could be ssa or kṣa. Then kuladāma seems plausible, though it looks more like dī and sa is possible instead of ma. Sanyal also reads a va at the very end of the line, which I cannot see.

daba siddham : The restoration of the illegibly corroded end of the line is shared by all editors (though Sanyal spells "dāmnośca a", presumably to account for the space of 4-5 characters). I could also imagine dāmnor a; the ca seems superfluous to me.

daba siddham : Agrawala attempts to reconstruct the end as viṣikhā-nadyāṁ (dyāṁ in the next line, that is). Earlier editors just transcribe a lacuna after grāmeṣu. I think the second vowel mātrā is ī, not i. The last character is absolutely illegible. I might hazard vibhītakyādyāṁ, but this doesn't really make sense.

daba siddham : The "mo" of paścimottara looks rather like ṇa. Compare l11 of IN00026 (Damodarpur plate 1) where the reading is paścinattar° emended to paścimottar° - that could be the same case. In l7 of the present inscription, mo looks the same, so this is not a "typo" here. 
--><!-- 
daba siddham : For the damaged bit near the end of l21, Sircar reads (?sadyaḥkhāta); Sanyal: (ā)dyakhāta; Agrawala: (ṣvā)dyakhāta. The first unclear character is imo completely unrecognisable; dy may or may not have a vowel mātrā above it; the next unclear character looks to me quite different from khā just a few characters onward in this line; after that, ta seems to have something below it (tsa? tma?) and the subscript thing also seems to be connected to pa, unless it's ma or something else (though parikhā makes good sense). I could also imagine ādyapathaḥ (or [°ddeśe]ṇādyapathaḥ, as in l23 below. In this case the visarga seems to be a later insertion, wedged below (tha) and the following pa and slightly below the regular placement.

daba siddham : Line 34 is squeezed into very little vertical space and contains characters only in two places, near the centre of the line and near the end. The word sa(ṁ)vvat begins below ma of mahīm; vaiśākha begins below the yo of chreyo.

daba siddham : Sircar and Agrawala read the date as 120. But N. B. Sanyal in Sen_1942:xii.n says it is 121, and Sanyal_1955-56 reiterates 121. Sircar_1943a:26n says he is aware of the faint scratches Sanyal sees as "1" but these are much further away from 20 than 20 is from 100 and thus they cannot be a third numeral. Sanyal_1955-56:66n3 insists that "The sign is distinct in the original" (to which he had access, while Sircar worked from inked impressions alone), while Sanyal's editor (ibid.) says "The reading 20 1 seems be [sic] supported neither by the original nor by the impressions" But this needs checking in hardcopy; my digital versions are badly scanned at the critical point and the note may not in fact say "20 1" but something else, and may have the missing "to" after seems. In my opinion the sign does look quite distinct, but I agree completely with Sircar that if it were a 1 rather than an accidental scratch, it would be much closer to the 20. The character above the place where the 1 should be (tāṁ of mahimatāṁ) does extend down to this line, but there would have been plenty of space below it to fit in a horizontal dash. I should also add that this line is much longer than the 1 after vaiśākha at the end of this line and the 2-s above in this plate, which again implies that it's an accidental scratch.

				and the council greet the peasant householders of the village beginning with the brahmins, <supplied reason="explanation">residing</supplied> next to Hasti, i.e. in Vibhītakā,<note>As the previous translations of this inscription show it, there are several possibilities to interpret <foreign>hastiśīrṣe</foreign>. The translation of <bibl><ptr target="bib:Sircar1943_02"/></bibl> is somewhat unclear. Indeed, in his translation of the line 1, he reads <foreign>hastiśīrṣavibhītakyāṁ</foreign> and translates 'residing in Hastiśīrṣavibhītakī'. In line 20, his translation of <foreign>hastiśīrṣa-vibhītakyāṁ</foreign> by 'Hastiśīrṣavibhītakī' might be supported by the singular locative. But in lines 23-24, the text compells him to consider Hastiśīrṣa an independant place name. At the end of his translation, he adds a note and criticizes the understanding of the place names suggested by Sanyal : <quote>It will be seen from the note that Sanyal has failed to decipher many important passages of the record including several geographical names. His suggestion regarding the two villages Hastiśīrṣa and Vibhītakī is not supported by the passage <foreign>hastiśīrṣa-vibhītakyāṁ</foreign> of the text.</quote> 
Indeed <bibl><ptr target="bib:Sanyal1955-1956_01"/><citedRange unit="page">58-9</citedRange></bibl> doesn't follow <bibl><ptr target="bib:Sircar1943_02"/></bibl>'s understanding and consider Hastiśīrṣa and Vibhītakī two different names of village. 
					To clarify the problem, I give below the three contexts where the word <foreign>hastiśīrṣa</foreign> appears in the text : 
					<list rend="numbered">
						<item>in association with the place name Vibhītakī, but not in compound: <foreign>hastiśīrṣe vibhītakyāṁ</foreign> (line 1)</item>
						<item>in association and in compound with the place name Vibhītakī: <foreign>hastiśīrṣavibhītakyāṁ</foreign> (line 20)</item>
						<item>in compound and in association with another place name Tāpasapotaka : <foreign>hastiśīrṣaprāveśyatāpasapottake</foreign> (line 23)</item>
					</list>
						The first interpretation could be to understand a place name 'Hastiśīrṣa' as <bibl><ptr target="bib:Sanyal1955-1956_01"/></bibl> did. A second possibility is to see <foreign>hastiśīrṣa</foreign> as a compound indicating a large aera. This interpretation is based on my previous observation according to which the geographical indication is presented from the larger to the smaller entity. So it could be possible to consider <foreign>śīrṣa</foreign>- a word used in a geographical manner to indicate that some place is near another larger place and <foreign>hasti</foreign>- a name of place like Hastināpura? If so, the translation could be 'in the upper part of Hasti', 'collateral of Hasti', close or next to Hasti. A third possibility could be to consider <foreign>hastiśīrṣa</foreign> a compound composed by the derivated word of the constellation name Hasta followed by <foreign>śīrṣa</foreign>, like in the compound <foreign>mārgaśīrṣa</foreign> 'the month under the constellation of Mṛga' (ie. november-september) which is recorded in Monier-Williams and by several inscriptions (for example: <ref target="http://siddham.uk/inscription/in00090">Betul Charter of Samksobha, year 199</ref>, line 3)<!-- amwb : I also found mārgaśīrṣa in in the Kesaribedā Donation of Arthapati line 13 (siddham IN1003) and in Kauvatal Charter of Sudevarāja line 24 -->. But the irregular derivation in <foreign>hastiśīrṣa</foreign> and the context of its use do not allow a such interpretation.

			<p n="18-19">In this territory the sale of one <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign> in exchange of two <foreign>dīnāra</foreign>s to be used for a permanent endowment of a waste land without revenue charges to be enjoyed in perpetuity is customary. So <supplied reason="explanation">tad</supplied>, let the gift be made!</p>
			<p n="19-24">After those beginning with the artisan Bhīma have established that there is no conflict whatsoever <supplied reason="subaudible">with the interest of the king</supplied>, after eighteen <foreign>dīnāra</foreign>s collected <supplied reason="explanation">upasaṁhr̥taka</supplied> had been taken in cash, eight <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign>s are located in the south in Vibhītakī next to Hasti/in the ensemble of Hastiśīrṣa and Vibhītakī,<note>
				Here there are three possibilities to understand, analyse or correct <foreign>hastiśīrṣavibhītakyāṁ</foreign> :
				<list rend="numbered">
					<item>consider <foreign>śīrṣa</foreign>- as an geographical indication and translate 'in Vibhītakī next to Hasti'</item>
					<item>analyse the singular as a scribal error and correct it by a duel form : <foreign>hastiśīrṣavibhītakyor</foreign></item>
					<item>as Arlo suggests, read <foreign>vibhītakī</foreign> in order to have a long compound <foreign>hastiśīrṣa-vibhītakī-dhānyapāṭalikā-gulmagandhikā-grameṣu</foreign> </item>
				</list>
			</note> in the villages Dhānyapāṭalikā and Gulmagandhikā,<note>
				Here one would have prefered a dual instead of a plural.
			</note> in Khanī<gap reason="lost" unit="character" quantity="2"/>dī; 
				one <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign> is located in the north-west of the village Dhānyapāṭalikā surrounded by a recently excavated ditch, with Vāṭā river in the north <supplied reason="explanation">and</supplied> bordered by the village Gulmagandhikā the in the west;
			two <foreign>droṇavāpa</foreign>s are located in the west in Gulmagandhikā with the first road at the east;
			and also <supplied reason="explanation">caiva</supplied> seven <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign>s and six <foreign>droṇavāpa</foreign>s <supplied reason="explanation">are located</supplied> in Citravātaṅgara falling under <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>prāveśya</foreign></supplied> Vibhītakī,<note>
				I consider <foreign>vibhītaka</foreign> a scribal error as the place name Vibhītakī is well spelled in lines 1 and 20.
			</note>
			in the hamlets/localities/estates Dayitā and Tāpasa / in Dayitāpotaka and Tāpasapotaka,<note>
				It seems to me that the term <foreign>potaka</foreign> could refer to a subtype of geographical toponym like in french words "lieu-dit, maison, domaine, propriété, bourgade, hameau, patelin".
			</note> the latter one falling under <supplied reason="explanation">the region</supplied> next/close to Hasti / Hastiśīrṣa.</p>
			<p n="24-27">In the regions of the above-mentionned villages,<note>
				One can note the parallelism between the expression <foreign>eṣu yathopari-nirddiṣṭaka-grāma-pradeśeṣv</foreign> and the one used in line 15-16 : <foreign>ebhir evopari-nirddiṣṭaka-grāmeṣu</foreign>.
			</note> in order to increase the merits of each mother and father of them, the artisan <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kulika</foreign></supplied> Bhīma, the scribes <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kāyastha</foreign></supplied> give for the performance of the five great sacrifices five <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign>s, <abbr><foreign>ku</foreign></abbr> 5, to the Brahmin Devabhaṭṭa, two <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign>s to <supplied reason="subaudible">the Brahmin</supplied> Amaradatta, two <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign>s, <abbr><foreign>ku</foreign></abbr> 2, to <supplied reason="subaudible">the Brahmin</supplied> Mahāsenadatta.</p>
			<p n="27-28">Thus <supplied reason="explanation">tad</supplied>, it is known <supplied reason="explanation">nivedyate?</supplied> through our <supplied reason="lost">request?</supplied> and it is written : these nine <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign> are given to these three recipients for the performance of the five great sacrifices.</p>
			<p n="28-29">Those who <supplied reason="explanation">live</supplied> in the present time <supplied reason="explanation">samupasthita-kālaṁ</supplied>, ie. the district officers <supplied reason="explanation">viṣayapati</supplied>, the officers, the peasant householders, the council members and the others who in the near future will be administrating <supplied reason="explanation">this land</supplied>,<note>
				The lines 28-29 are really close to the lines 22-24 of <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00034.xml">the Jagadispur Charter of the Time of Kumāragupta I</ref>.
			</note> after considering the benefits of land donation, will have to protect <supplied reason="explanation">this land</supplied> as a permanent endowment.</p>
			<p n="29-30">And the venerable Vyāsa said in the <title>Mahābhārata</title>:</p>
